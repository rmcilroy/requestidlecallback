<p>This document defines an API that web page authors can use to cooperatively schedule background tasks such that they do not introduce delays to other high priority tasks that share the same event loop, such as input processing, animations and frame compositing. The user agent is in a better position to determine when background tasks can be run without introducing user-perceptible delays or jank in animations and input response, based on its knowledge of currently scheduled tasks, vsync deadlines, user-interaction and so on.  Using this API should therefore result in more appropriate scheduling of background tasks during times when the browser would otherwise be idle.</p>

<section id="introduction" class='informative'>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Web pages often want to execute computation tasks on the browser's event loop which are not time-critical, but might take a significant portion of time to perform. Examples of such background tasks include recording analytics data to <code>localStorage</code> [[webstorage]], long running data
processing operations, client-side templating and pre-rendering of content likely to become visible in the near future. These tasks must share the event loop with other time-critical operations, such as reacting to input and performing script-based animations using <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> [[animation-timing]]. These background tasks are typically performed by scheduling a callback using <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#dom-windowtimers-settimeout">setTimeout</a></code> and running the background task during that callback.
</p>

<p>
A disadvantage of this approach is that the author of the script has no way to inform the user-agent as to whether a given <code>setTimeout</code> callback is time-critical or could be delayed until the browser is otherwise idle. In addition, the user agent isn't able to provide the callback with any information about how long it can continue to execute without delaying time-critical operations and causing jank or other user-perceptible delays. As a result, the easiest way forward is for the author is to simply call <code>setTimeout</code> with a very small value, and then execute the minimum possible chunk of work in the resulting callback and reschedule additional work with another call to <code>setTimeout</code>.  This is less than optimal because there is extra overhead from having to post many small tasks on the user agent's event loop and schedule their execution. It also relies on the user-agent interleaving other time-critical work between each of these callbacks appropriately, which is difficult since the user-agent can't make any assumptions on how long each of these callbacks are likely to take.
</p>

<p>
The API described in this document allows script authors to request the user-agent to schedule a callback when it would otherwise be idle. The user agent provides an estimation of how long it expects to remain idle as a deadline passed to the callback. The page author can use the deadline to
ensure that these background tasks don't impact latency-critical events such as animation and input response.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of using the API to
write a background task.

<h2>Idle Periods</h2>

<p>
After input processing, rendering and compositing for a given frame has been completed, the user agent's main thread often becomes idle until either: the next frame begins; another pending task becomes eligible to run; or user input is received. This specification provides a means to schedule execution of callbacks during this otherwise idle time via a <code>requestIdleCallback</code> API.
</p>

<p>
Callbacks posted via the <code>requestIdleCallback</code> API become eligible to run during user agent defined idle periods. When an idle callback is run it will be given a deadline which corresponds to the end of the current idle period. The decision as to what constitutes an idle period is user agent defined, however the expectation is that they occur in periods of quiescence where the browser expects to be idle.
</p>

<p>
One example of an idle period is the time between committing a given frame to the screen and starting processing on the next frame during active animations, as shown in <a href="#figure1"></a>. Such idle periods will occur frequently during active animations and screen updates, but will typically be very short
(i.e., less than 16ms for devices with a 60Hz vsync cycle).
</p>

<figure id='figure1'>
<img alt="Example of an inter-frame idle period." src="images/image01.png">
<figcaption>Example of an inter-frame idle period</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="note">
The user should be careful to account for all work performed by operations during an idle callback. Some operations, such as resolving a promise or triggering a page layout, may cause
subsequent tasks to be scheduled to run after the idle callback has finished. In such cases, the application should account for this additional work by yielding before the deadline expires to allow these operations to be performed before the next frame deadline.
</p>

<p>
Another example of an idle period is when the user agent is idle with no screen updates occurring. In such a situation the user agent may have no upcoming tasks with which it can bound the end of the idle period. In order to avoid causing user-perceptible delays in unpredictable tasks, such as processing of user input, the length of these idle periods should be capped to a maximum value of <a href="#why50">50ms</a>. Once an idle period is finished the user agent can schedule another idle period if it remains idle, as shown in <a href='#figure2'></a>, to enable background work to continue to occur over longer idle time periods.
</p>

<figure id='figure2'>
<img alt="Example of an idle period when there are no pending frame updates." src="images/image00.png">
<figcaption>Example of an idle period when there are no pending frame updates</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
During an idle period the user agent will run idle callbacks in FIFO order until either the idle period ends or there are no more idle callbacks eligible to be run. As such, the user agent will not necessarily run all currently posted idle callbacks within a single idle period. Any remaining idle tasks are eligible to run during the next idle period. Only idle tasks which
were posted before the start of the current idle period are
eligible to be run during the current idle period. This enables
idle callbacks to re-post themselves to be run in a future idle
period if they cannot complete their work by a given deadline. At
the start of the next idle period newly posted idle callbacks are
appended to the end of the runnable idle callback list, thus
ensuring that reposting callbacks will be run round-robin style,
with each callback getting a chance to be run before that of an
earlier task's reposted callback.
</p>
<p>
When the user agent determines that the web
page is not user visible it can throttle idle periods to reduce the
power usage of the device, for example, only triggering an idle
period every 10 seconds rather than continuously.
</p>
<p>
A final subtlety to note is that there is no
guarantee that a user agent will have any idle CPU time available
during heavy page load. As such, it is entirely acceptable that the
user agent does not schedule any idle period, which would result in the
idle callbacks posted via the <code>requestIdleCallback</code> API
being postponed for a potentially unbounded amount of time. In
order to provide script authors with a guarantee that these
callbacks will be run, authors can specify a timeout by which the
callback should be run by setting the <code>timeout</code> property in the
<code>options</code> argument to <code>requestIdleCallback</code>.
</p>

<p class="note" id='why50'>
The maximum deadline of 50ms is derived from studies [[RESPONSETIME]] which show that that a response to user input within 100ms is generally perceived as instantaneous to humans. Capping idle deadlines to 50ms means that even if the user input occurs immediately after the idle task has begun, the user agent still has a remaining 50ms in which to respond to the user input without producing user perceptible lag.

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
Each <code>Document</code> has:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a <dfn>list of idle request callbacks</dfn>, which MUST be initially empty,</li>
<li>a <dfn>list of runnable idle callbacks</dfn>, which MUST be initially empty,</li>
<li>and an <dfn>idle callback identifier</dfn>, which is a number which MUST initially be zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When <code>requestIdleCallback(callback, options)</code> is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Let <var>document</var> be the <code>Window</code> object's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#active-document">active document</a> object. [[!HTML5]]
</li>
<li>Increment the <var>document</var>'s <a>idle callback identifier</a> by one.</li>
<li>Let <var>handle</var> be the <var>document</var>'s <a>idle callback identifier</a>'s current value</li>
<li>Append <var>callback</var> to <var>document</var>'s <a>list of idle request callbacks</a>, associated with <var>handle</var>.</li>
<li>Return <var>handle</var> and then continue running this
algorithm asynchronously.</li>
<li>If the <var>timeout</var> property is present in <var>options</var> and has a positive value:
<ol type='a'>
  <li>Wait for <var>timeout</var> milliseconds.</li>
  <li>Wait until any invocations of this algorithm started before this one whose <var>timeout</var> is equal to or less than this one's have completed.</li>
  <li>Optionally, wait a further user-agent defined length of time.
  <p class='note'>
This is intended to allow user agents to pad timeouts as needed to optimise the power usage of the device. For example, some processors have a low-power mode where the granularity of timers is reduced; on such platforms, user agents can slow timers down to fit this schedule instead of requiring the
processor to use the more accurate mode with its associated higher power usage.
  </p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">Queue a task</a> on the queue associated with the idle-task task
source, which performs the <a>invoke idle callback timeout algorithm</a>, passing <var>handle</var> and <var>document</var> as arguments.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">
<code>requestIdleCallback</code> only schedules a single callback, which will be executed during a single <a>idle period</a>. If the callback cannot complete its work before the given <var>deadline</var> then it should call <code>requestIdleCallback</code> again (which may be done from within the callback) to schedule a future callback for the continuation of its task, and exit immediately to return control back to the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#event-loop'>event loop</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>cancelIdleCallback</code> method is used to cancel a previously made request to schedule an idle callback.
When <code>cancelIdleCallback(handle)</code> is called, the user agent MUST run the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Let <var>document</var> be the <code>Window</code> object's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#active-document">active document</a> object. [[!HTML5]]
</li>
<li>Find the entry in either the <var>document</var>'s <a>list of idle request callbacks</a> or the <var>document</var>'s <a>list of runnable idle callbacks</a> that is associated with the value <var>handle</var>.</li>
<li>If there is such an entry, remove it from both the <var>document</var>'s <a>list of idle request callbacks</a> and the <var>document</var>'s <a>list of runnable idle callbacks</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p class='note'>
<code>cancelIdleCallback</code> might be invoked for an entry in the <var>document</var>'s <a>list of idle request callbacks</a> or the <var>document</var>'s <a>list of runnable idle callbacks</a> . In either case the entry should be removed from the list so that the callback does not run.
</p>
<p>
This value is calculated by performing the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Let <var>deadline</var> be the deadline of the associated callback as a <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time-2/#dom-domhighrestimestamp">DOMHighResTimeStamp</a></code>. [[!hr-time-2]]</li>
<li>Let <var>now</var> be the value returned by <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time-2/#widl-Performance-now-DOMHighResTimeStamp">performance.now()</a></code>. [[!hr-time-2]]</li>
<li>Let <var>timeRemaining</var> be <var>deadline</var> - <var>now</var>.</li>
<li>If <var>timeRemaining</var> is negative, set it to 0.</li>
<li>Return <var>timeRemaining</var>.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Processing Model</h2>
<p>
Whenever the user agent assesses that a given <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#event-loop">event loop</a> is likely to remain idle for a non-trivial amount of time, it SHOULD initiate a new idle period for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#event-loop">event loop</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
The expectation is that the user agent will initiate idle periods regularly when the event loop becomes idle, for example, in between frame rendering and regularly during times when no frames are being rendered. If the <code>Document</code>'s <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/#dom-document-hidden">hidden</a></code> attribute
[[page-visibility]] is false then the user agent can throttle idle period generation, for example limiting the Document to one idle period every 10 seconds to optimize for power usage.
</p>

<p>When the user agent wishes to start an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#event-loop">event loop</a>'s idle period, the following steps MUST be performed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let <var>last_deadline</var> be the last idle period deadline associated with the current event loop, or 0 if no previous deadline exists.</li>
<li>If <var>last_deadline</var> is greater than the current time:
<ol>
<li>Wait until the current time is greater than or equal to <var>last_deadline</var>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Let <var>now</var> be the current time.</li>
<li>Let <var>deadline</var> be a time in the future until which the browser expects to remain idle.</li>
<li>If <var>deadline</var> - <var>now</var> is greater than 50ms, then cap <var>deadline</var> by setting it to
be <var>now</var> + 50ms.</li>
<li>Let <var>docs</var> be the list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#fully-active">fully active</a> <code>Document</code> objects associated with the event loop in question, sorted arbitrarily.</li>
<li>For every <var>document</var> in <var>docs</var>, in any order, perform the following steps:
<ol type="a">
<li>Let <var>doclist</var> be <var>document</var>'s <a>list of idle request callbacks</a>.</li>
<li>Let <var>runlist</var> be <var>document</var>'s <a>list of runnable idle callbacks</a>.</li>
<li>Append all entries from <var>doclist</var> into <var>runlist</var> preserving order.</li>
<li>Clear <var>doclist</var>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">Queue a task</a> which performs the steps defined in the <a>invoke idle callbacks algorithm</a> with parameters <var>runlist</var> and <var>deadline</var>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</ol>

<div class="note">
<p>
The time between <var>now</var> and <var>deadline</var> is referred to as the <dfn>idle period</dfn>. There can only be one
idle period active at a given time. The idle period can end early

so, the next idle period cannot start until after <var>deadline</var>.
</p>
<p>
Also note, the expectation is
that the user agent will choose <var>deadline</var> to ensure that no time-critical
tasks will be delayed even if a callback runs for the whole time
period from <var>now</var> to <var>deadline</var>. As such, it should be set
to the minimum of: the closest timeout in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#list-of-active-timers">list of active timers</a> as set via

pending internal timeouts such as deadlines to start rendering the
